# QuickBless Mod for Cult of the Lamb

## Description
QuickBless allows you to bless followers without having to manually click on each one or navigate through the menus. Simply press the 'B' key to bless the currently targeted follower. This saves you time and effort when managing your cult.

## Requirements
- BepInEx (BepInExPack_CultOfTheLamb version 5.4.2100 or higher)

## Installation
1. Download and extract the mod into your "BepInEx" directory of Cult of the Lamb.
2. Make sure you have BepInEx installed correctly (refer to the BepInEx setup guide if needed).
3. Launch Cult of the Lamb, and the mod will be ready to use.
4. Press the 'B' key to bless the currently selected follower.

## Important Note
The 'B' key is already assigned to an in-game action. In order for this mod to work, you must rebind the 'B' key to another function in the game's settings. After changing the key binding, the mod will function as expected.

## Uninstallation
1. Simply remove the `QuickBless.dll` file from the `BepInEx\plugins` directory.
2. Restart the game, and the mod will no longer be active.

## Changelog
### v1.0.0
