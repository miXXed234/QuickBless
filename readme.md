# Quick Bless Mod

## What it does?
The "Quick Bless Mod" for **Cult of the Lamb** allows you to quickly bless all followers with just the press of a button (B by default), saving you from manually clicking on each follower and selecting the blessing option.

Instead of going through the in-game interaction menu, this mod enables a much faster way to bless your followers, enhancing the gameplay experience by streamlining the process.

## Requirements:
- **BepInEx** (for mod loading)
- **Harmony** (for patching and modifying game functions)
- **Cult of the Lamb** game installed

## Installation:

1. Download and extract the mod zip file.
2. Place the `BlessAllMod.dll` into the `BepInEx\plugins` folder of your **Cult of the Lamb** installation directory.
3. Configure your in-game **B key** in the controls settings if it is already bound to another function.
4. Start the game, and when you press the **B key**, all nearby followers will receive a blessing.

## Uninstallation:
1. To remove the mod, simply delete the `BlessAllMod.dll` from the `BepInEx\plugins` folder.
2. Restart the game, and the mod will no longer be active.
